 # this.dictionaries
**A Rust crate for standardized, modular dictionaries used across the `all.this` ecosystem.**

This crate will include essential datasets, key-value references, code lists, and vocabularies commonly used in machine learning, identity, linguistics, localization, and data normalization.

### Goals
- Provide reusable, language-agnostic dictionaries
- Enable consistent lookups across `neurons.me`, `cleaker`, and other components
- Serve as the canonical source of normalized tags and attribute names

### Status
Early development — foundational structures are being defined.
